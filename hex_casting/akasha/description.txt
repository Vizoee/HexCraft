Akasha stores functions in 2 separate ways
    name of function in hexicon - 
        compiled version of function
        ready to use version of function that is stripped of aditional data
        can be exported as its own function (minimalizes usage of akasha)
        all uncompiled functions are converted to compiled ones and inserted directly into this function
    name of function in hexicon with "_" at start -
        uncompiled version of function
        more detailed version of function. contains:
            [0]name of function in string (bubbled - unbubbled durring reading)
            [1]description (bubbled - unbubbled durring reading)
            [2]list of patterns (bubbled - unbubbled durring reading)
            execution of patterns (vv hermes)
        list of patterns will prefer containing other uncomplied version of function
