parsing by word vs by char:
    word will be faster
    char will allow for more customization
    word will be easier but less serialized
    word will have more steps
    word will be easier to implement partially
result: parse by word


stages:
    remove comments
    parse variables
        split by spaces
        check if known symbol
            if not add new symbol to 
                stack
                ravenmind
    parse functions (can be merged with variables)


idea:
    end result will be list of something :3 (can be processed further)
    convert string into list of symbols
    find all specific symbols
    get closest
    get its function
        balanced symbols: <> {} [] etc:
            open symbol places object on stack with start index
            takes object from stack
                can throw there exceptions if incorrect object



ravenmind
    result
    stack
        object_parser
            [0]type
            [1]start_index
            [2]parsed_data
    list_of_symbols?
    last_symbol - id of symbol
    list_of_last_found - list of last index of each symbol or 65536 if not found (spell shouldn't be longet than that)
    

ravenmind: = main function
    list of unique names
    list of variables
    list of functions




object_types - (static ids):
    < > - puts value into stack
        "" - string
        number - number
        ? - vector
        ? - gate
        ? - garbage
        ? - types
        name - pattern from akasha (akasha can contain all hexcasting patterns)
    { } - creates list
    ( )
    [ ]
    \<
    \>
    \\
    \{
    \}
    \(
    \)
    \[

require(vector) - returns object for akasha retrival
mainly used for develepment
by default 1 object already exists for currently binded akasha
